Description: 
Naive implementation of Mandelbrot set algorithm in MPI. It uses loop-splitting approach to decompose task.  

Goal: 
Practicing parallel programming environment and measure speed difference between serial and parallel versions. 

To do list: 
1. Error handling of positional parameter values of the positional parameters 
2. Increase the accuracy of the finding Mandelbrot set ... 
3. And any other ideas should go here.
