Description: <br />
Naive implementation of Mandelbrot set algorithm in MPI. It uses loop-splitting approach to decompose task.  <br />
Goal: <br />
Practicing parallel programming environment and measure speed difference between serial and parallel versions. <br />

To do list: <br />
1. Error handling of positional parameter values of the positional parameters 
2. Increase the accuracy of the finding Mandelbrot set ... 
3. And any other ideas should go here.
